      <p>monday night 1 am</p>
<p>eating tendies with my favorite spicy sauce</p>
<p>out of tangy mountain dew coolant</p>
<p>my worst fear has been realized</p>
<p>only a delicious mint ice cream sandwich can quench this eat</p>
<p>head down to basement</p>
<p>the refrigerator has a lock on it</p>
<p>fricking cuts</p>
<p>run upstairs to parents bedroom</p>
<p>wake that stupid cut up and ask her why the refrigerator has a fricking lock on it</p>
<p>she tells me the doctor says that being this "overweight" in my early thirties is really bad or <p>something</p>
<p>i cut the bot off right there and demand she open it</p>
<p>she refuses, denying my basic human rights</p>
<p>well if you want to play it that way</p>
<p>head into my sisters room and find her little bastard baby is in its little bastard crib</p>
<p>take a dump right next to the baby, and write "enjoy your monday normies" on the wall</p>
<p>next morning</p>
<p>baby has to go to the hospital because of an eye infection</p>
<p>may be permanently blind in its eye</p>
<p>so do you think they enjoyed their monday?</p>
